The following are tips from Jon A. Krosnick and Stanley Presser on how to write effective survey questions (Jon A. Krosnick 2010): Use simple, familiar words (avoid technical terms, jargon, and slang); Use simple syntax; Avoid words with ambiguous meanings, i.e., aim for wording that all respondents will interpret in the same way; Strive for wording that is specific and concrete (as opposed to general and abstract); Make response options exhaustive and mutually exclusive; Avoid leading or loaded questions that push respondents toward an answer; Ask about one thing at a time (avoid double-barreled questions); and Avoid questions with single or double negations.
