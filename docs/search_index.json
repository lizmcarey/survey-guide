We developed this book in the hopes of future collaboration among other UX researchers. Outline The content of the book will include: Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Prerequisites All you need is an interest in conducting survey research and basic data analysis, we’ll include code snippets (python and R) along the way. Acknowledgements This book wouldn’t be possible without the contributions of: "],

First, establish if a survey is the right method to accomplish your research goal by asking yourself: What do you currently know? What don’t you know? Below is a useful visualization from the Nielsen Norman group on how to decide between which qualitative or quantitative methods to answer your research goal (Rohrer 2014). Surveys are great for answering the “How many and how much” of what people do and say; surveys are not the best method at understanding the “Why and how to fix” a product problem. 1.2 Who are you studying? This question may be simple at first, but when you start to narrow down References "],

This section assumes you have a laptop set up to work with in either R or python. Head over to the Appendix page if you need help with set up. 3.1 Organize your workspace Before beginning any analysis, you’ll want to set up a reproducible workflow. Below is an adapted suggestion on how to organize your workspace from Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger, and Lincoln Mullen (Ben Marwick 2018). Keeping your workspace organized is the best way for you and others to understand and reproduce your analysis. project |- DESCRIPTION # project metadata and dependencies |- README.md # top-level description of content and guide to users | |- data/ # data files used | +- raw_data.csv # data files in open formats such as TXT, CSV, TSV, etc. | +- cleaned_data.csv # data files that have been cleaned, merged, etc that you&#39;ll use for survey analysis | |- analysis/ # any programmatic code | +- my_report.Rmd # R markdown file with narrative text interwoven with code chunks | +- makefile # builds a PDF/HTML/DOCX file from the Rmd, code, and data files | +- scripts/ # code files (R, shell, etc.) used for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation | +- figures/ # saved outputs of your figures | |- R/ | +- my_functions.R # custom R functions that are used more than once throughout the project | |- man/ | +- my_functions.Rd # documentation for the R functions (auto-generated when using devtools) | R version #List the directory names you want to create folder_names &lt;- c(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;data/raw&quot;, &quot;data/clean&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;analysis/scripts&quot;, &quot;analysis/figures&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) #Create the directories sapply(folder_names, dir.create) 3.2 Data Cleaning Before you can begin looking at the results, you’ll need to clean the data. By “cleaning” the data, we mean edited the raw file into a format that will make the analysis valid and easier. 3.2.1 Load the data Download your raw survey data as a csv and load it into your your analysis tool of choice (e.g. Ipython notebook or Rstudio) R version #load necessary packages for analysis library(tidyverse) #contains all the library packages to manipulate and transform data library(summarytools) #shortcut tools to visualize summaries of the data #read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe) #replace &quot;file&quot; with &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizmcarey/survey-guide/master/sample_data/Survey_test_data.csv&quot; to download the survey data set df &lt;- read_csv(file) python version #load necessary modules for analysis import pandas as pd #read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe) df = pd.read_csv(filename) 3.2.2 Loading Qualtrics data When you download a csv from Qualtrics, it will come with a few extra rows you don’t need. Here are some automated scripts you can add to your makefile to speed up your work =flow R version manual #Store the column names by reading in the column header df_names &lt;- read_csv(file, n_max=0) %&gt;% names() #Read the entire file, df &lt;- read_csv(file, col_names = df_names, #use df_names to title the columns skip = 3) #skip the first three lines #store the question names question_bank &lt;- read_csv(file, n_max=1) %&gt;% #read in the first row of file select(starts_with(&quot;Q&quot;)) %&gt;% #select columns that start with Q gather(key, question_text) #move data from wide to long R version programmatic load_qualtrics_csv &lt;- function(file) { squirrel &lt;- read_csv(file, n_max = 0) %&gt;% names() squirrel_2 &lt;- read_csv(file, col_names = df_names, skip = 3) } get_questions &lt;- function(file) { qb &lt;- read_csv(file, n_max = 1) %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;Q&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key, question_text) } df &lt;- load_qualtrics_csv(file) question_bank &lt;- get_questions(file) 3.2.3 Preview the data It’s important to get a look at the data to spot an errors in uploading, etc. References "],
