# Survey Analysis {#analysis}

After you've fielded your survey, here are the steps to making sense of the data. 

This section assumes you have a laptop set up to work with in either R or python. Head over to the Appendix page if you need help with set up. 

## Organize your workspace

Before beginning any analysis, you'll want to set up a reproducible workflow. Below is an adapted suggestion on how to organize your workspace from Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger, and Lincoln Mullen  [@reproducible_workflow]. Keeping your workspace organized is the best way for you and others to understand and reproduce your analysis. 

```
project
|- DESCRIPTION          # project metadata and dependencies 
|- README.md            # top-level description of content and guide to users
|
|- data/                # data files used 
|  +- raw_data.csv      # data files in open formats such as TXT, CSV, TSV, etc.
|  +- cleaned_data.csv  # data files that have been cleaned, merged, etc that you'll use for survey analysis
|
|- analysis/            # any programmatic code
|  +- my_report.Rmd     # R markdown file with narrative text interwoven with code chunks 
|  +- makefile          # builds a PDF/HTML/DOCX file from the Rmd, code, and data files
|  +- scripts/          # code files (R, shell, etc.) used for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation
|  +- figures/          # saved outputs of your figures
|
|- R/                     
|  +- my_functions.R    # custom R functions that are used more than once throughout the project
|
|- man/
|  +- my_functions.Rd   # documentation for the R functions (auto-generated when using devtools)
|

```


**R version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#List the directory names you want to create
folder_names <- c("data", 
                    "data/raw", 
                    "data/clean", 
                  "analysis", 
                    "analysis/scripts", 
                     "analysis/figures", 
                  "R")

#Create the directories
sapply(folder_names, dir.create)
```



## Data Cleaning  

Before you can begin looking at the results, you'll need to clean the data. By "cleaning" the data, we mean edited the raw file into a format that will make the analysis valid and easier. 

### Load the data

Download your raw survey data as a csv and load it into your your analysis tool of choice (e.g. Ipython notebook or Rstudio)

**R version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary packages for analysis
library(tidyverse)        #contains all the library packages to manipulate and transform data
library(summarytools)     #shortcut tools to visualize summaries of the data

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
#replace "file" with "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizmcarey/survey-guide/master/sample_data/Survey_test_data.csv" to download the survey data set
df <- read_csv(file)

```

**python version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary modules for analysis
import pandas as pd

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

```

### Loading Qualtrics data

When you download a csv from Qualtrics, it will come with a few extra rows you don't need. Here are some automated scripts you can add to your makefile to speed up your workflow 

**R version manual**
```{r, eval=FALSE}

#Store the column names by reading in the column header
df_names <- read_csv(file, n_max=0) %>% names()

#Read the entire file,
df <- read_csv(file, 
               col_names = df_names, #use df_names to title the columns
               skip = 3) #skip the first three lines

#store the question names
question_bank <- read_csv(file, n_max=1) %>%  #read in the first row of file
                 select(starts_with("Q")) %>% #select columns that start with Q
                 gather(key, question_text) #move data from wide to long

```

**R version programmatic**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#function to load qualtrics csv and remove extra rows
load_qualtrics_csv <- function(file) {
  df_names <- read_csv(file, n_max = 0) %>% names()
  
  df <- read_csv(file, col_names = df_names, skip = 3)
}

#function to store questions
get_questions <- function(file) {
  qb <- read_csv(file, n_max = 1) %>% 
        select(starts_with("Q")) %>% 
        gather(key, question_text)
}

#Use function to read in survey file, and skip first 3 lines
df <- load_qualtrics_csv(file)

#Use function to store question wording
question_bank <- get_questions(file)
```

### Preview the data

It's important to get a look at the data to spot an errors in uploading, etc.
