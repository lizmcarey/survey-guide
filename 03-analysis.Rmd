# Survey Analysis {#analysis}

After you've fielded your survey, here are the steps to making sense of the data. 

This section assumes you have a laptop set up to work with in either R or python. Head over to the Appendix page if you need help with set up. 

## Organize your workspace

Before beginning any analysis, you'll want to set up a reproducible workflow. Below is an adapted suggestion on how to organize your workspace from Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger, and Lincoln Mullen  [@reproducible_workflow]. Keeping your workspace organized is the best way for you and others to understand and reproduce your analysis. 

```
project
|- DESCRIPTION          # project metadata and dependencies 
|- README.md            # top-level description of content and guide to users
|
|- data/                # data files used 
|  +- raw_data.csv      # data files in open formats such as TXT, CSV, TSV, etc.
|  +- cleaned_data.csv  # data files that have been cleaned, merged, etc that you'll use for survey analysis
|
|- analysis/            # any programmatic code
|  +- my_report.Rmd     # R markdown file with narrative text interwoven with code chunks 
|  +- makefile          # builds a PDF/HTML/DOCX file from the Rmd, code, and data files
|  +- scripts/          # code files (R, shell, etc.) used for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation
|  +- figures/          # saved outputs of your figures
|
|- R/                     
|  +- my_functions.R    # custom R functions that are used more than once throughout the project
|
|- man/
|  +- my_functions.Rd   # documentation for the R functions (auto-generated when using devtools)
|

```

Example code to set up workflow

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#List the directory names
folder_names <- c("data", 
                    "data/raw", 
                    "data/clean", 
                  "analysis", 
                    "analysis/scripts", 
                     "analysis/figures", 
                  "R")

#Create the directories
sapply(folder_names, dir.create)
```



## Data Cleaning  

Before you can begin looking at the results, you'll need to clean the data. By "cleaning" the data, we mean edited the raw file into a format that will make the analysis valid and easier. 

### Load the data

Download your raw survey data as a csv and load it into your your analysis tool of choice (e.g. Ipython notebook or Rstudio)

**R version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary packages for analysis
library(tidyverse)        #contains all the library packages to manipulate and transform data
library(summarytools)     #shortcut tools to visualize summaries of the data

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
df <- read_csv(file)

```

**python version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary modules for analysis
import pandas as pd

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

```

### Preview the data

It's important to get a look at the data to spot an errors in uploading, etc.
