# Survey Analysis {#analysis}

After you've fielded your survey, here are the steps to making sense of the data. 

This section assumes you have a laptop set up to work with in either R or python. Head over to the Appendix page if you need help with set up. 

## Data Cleaning  

Before you can begin looking at the results, you'll need to clean the data. 

### Load the data

Open your analysis tool of choice and download your raw survey data as a csv and load it into your 

**R version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary packages for analysis
library(tidyverse)

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
df <- read_csv(file)

```

**python version**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load necessary modules for analysis
import pandas as pd

#read/store the data as the variable df (short for dataframe)
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

```

### Preview the data

It's important to get a look at the data to spot an errors in uploading, etc.
