# Welcome to survey research {-}
![](figs/sponge_bob.png)

This book is intended to be a quick resource for conducting survey research. By no means is it intended to be comprehensive of all survey research methodologies.  

# Preface {-}

Hopefully you'll find this book to be a condensed and easy to read resource on survey research.

We developed this book in the hopes of future collaboration among other UX researchers. 

## Outline {-}
The content of the book will include:  

 * **Chapter 1**: Designing a survey
 * **Chapter 2**: Writing effective survey questions
 * **Chapter 3**: Survey Analysis
 
## Prerequisites {-}

All you need is an interest in conducting survey research and basic data analysis. I'll include snippets of R code to perform the analysis along the way, but if you want a more in-depth primer on R, feel free to check out this [Intro to R workshop](https://github.com/lizmcarey/intro_to_r_workshop) I've adapted from Amelia McNamara's [R Workshop](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR/blob/master/README.md)
 
## Acknowledgements {-}

This book wouldn't be possible without the contributions of: TBD
