# Welcome to survey research {-}
![](figs/sponge_bob.png)

This book is intended to be a quick resource for conducting survey research. By no means is it intended to be comprehensive of all survey research methodologies.  

# Preface {-}

Hopefully you'll find this book to be a condensed and easy to read resource on survey research.

We developed this book in the hopes of future collaboration among other UX researchers. 

## Outline {-}
The content of the book will include:  

 * **Chapter 1**
 * **Chapter 2**
 
## Prerequisites {-}

All you need is an interest in conducting survey research and basic data analysis, we'll include code snippets (python and R) along the way. 
 
## Acknowledgements {-}

This book wouldn't be possible without the contributions of:
