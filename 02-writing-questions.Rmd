# Writing effective survey questions

Effective survey questions result in **consistent** and **reliable** responses.

The following are tips from Jon A. Krosnick and Stanley Presser on how to write effective survey questions [@handbook_survey_research]:  

1. Use simple, familiar words (avoid technical terms, jargon, and slang);  
2. Use simple syntax;  
3. Avoid words with ambiguous meanings, i.e., aim for wording that all respondents  
will interpret in the same way;  
4. Strive for wording that is specific and concrete (as opposed to general and abstract);  
5. Make response options exhaustive and mutually exclusive;  
6. Avoid leading or loaded questions that push respondents toward an answer;  
7. Ask about one thing at a time (avoid double-barreled questions); and  
8. Avoid questions with single or double negations.
