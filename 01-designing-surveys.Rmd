# Designing a survey {#macro}

## What is your research goal? 

First, establish if a survey is the right method to accomplish your research goal by asking yourself:  

 * What do you currently know? 
 * What _don't_ you know?  
 
Below is a useful visualization from the Nielsen Norman group on how to decide between which qualitative or quantitative methods to answer your research goal [@nng_method].

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/nng_ux_methods_chart2.png")

```


Surveys are great for answering the **"How many and how much"** of what people do and say; surveys are not the best method at understanding the "Why and how to fix" a product problem.

## Who are you studying? 

Once you've determined your research goal, it's important to determine your target audience.
